1
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:06,400
Sync and fixed by Neeboo

2
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:12,960
There's a legend that precedes
the dawn of our civilization.

3
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:22,080
A vile god, so large and so powerful
that it consumed entire planets as fuel.

4
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:29,080
Few believed such a thing could be true
until the day we saw Unicron with our own eyes.

5
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:58,500
But he didn't just come for our planet,
he wanted our greatest technology.

6
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,700
The Transwarp Key.

7
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,900
And he sent his most
powerful henchmen to collect it.

8
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,700
Scourge.

9
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:59,720
More enemies are landing.
We won't be safe for long.

10
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,820
Do we have the key?

11
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,720
You must take it.

12
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:05,720
Keep it hidden.

13
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:08,720
So that it never falls
into the hands of Unicron.

14
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:11,720
But, Ape Link, we can fight.

15
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:15,220
No. Protecting our
transwarp key is all that matters.

16
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,720
Go. Use it to escape.

17
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:19,820
What will you do?

18
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,220
I'll hold him off.

19
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,720
I'll use some time.

20
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,720
Then I'm staying with you.

21
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,380
This is my fight. Listen...

22
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:35,020
If Unicron were to get the key, he could
open a portal through time and space 

23
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,240
with no end to the
worlds he could destroy.

24
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:41,520
It is now your time
to lead the Maximals,

25
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:43,640
Optimus Primal.

26
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:09,660
So you're this planet's great warrior.

27
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:16,880
You have such a beautiful world.

28
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:22,480
Filled with an abundance of life.

29
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:27,360
Savory.

30
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:30,280
My master grows hungry. 

31
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:36,280
Give me the Transwarp Key
and he will spare your home.

32
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:39,280
We'd rather die
than let him breach other planets.

33
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,320
So be it.

34
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,720
Benefits of serving the almighty Unicron.

35
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:08,220
They never learn.

36
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,320
Too late, Scourge.

37
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:14,520
Your master will be
trapped in this galaxy forever.

38
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,440
No.

39
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:32,220
His sacrifice will be our oath
to preserve the key,

40
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:35,420
 no matter the cost.

41
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:47,900
You let them slip away
with the Transwarp Key.

42
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:53,120
Scour the universe and find
where the Maximals have gone.

43
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:57,840
When you acquire the key,
use it to bring me to you.

44
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:00,160
Yes, my lord.

45
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:03,000
Once I have the key

46
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:06,500
I alone will reign supreme.

47
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,720
All right, baby, come on.

48
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,300
All right, show me the money.

49
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,200
Here we go.

50
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,460
Yo, Sonic, breakfast already up?

51
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,760
I ain't your butler, Chris.

52
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:25,260
Come on, man.
I'm calling himself the Airways.

53
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,260
It's Tails.

54
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,760
Oh, my bad.

55
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:31,660
Christopher Diaz
from 974 Wilson Avenue,

56
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,760
apartment 2C, Brooklyn.

57
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:36,760
No real name. They are listen.

58
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:39,760
Ain't no secret government
agency's worried about us Tails.

59
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,860
Now get your mind out of here while it's hot.

60
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,760
We still got that going for him.

61
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,760
Here, I earned this for you.
-I already earned it.

62
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,760
Like you cooked those eggs?

63
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,760
What you mean? It's just seasoned.

64
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,760
Oh, come on.

65
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,760
Come here, bro.

66
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,760
I can't get past Bowser.

67
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,760
Well, good morning to you, too.

68
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:00,760
Drink this and take your medicine, all of it.

69
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:03,060
Hey, are you sure you can take off?

70
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:05,760
Yeah, hospital's on the way.
You all got time?

71
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:08,760
That lady, that administrator is there,

72
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,360
and she mentions a bill.

73
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:14,060
Just... Tell her we're handling it.

74
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,760
I will.

75
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:18,260
And after today,
I'll be able to help out more.

76
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,160
Good luck on the interview.

77
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,260
Don't forget to laugh at all the jokes.

78
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:25,560
White people love that shit.
-Ma, language.

79
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:27,260
Okay.

80
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,860
Remember I have class tonight,
so I'll be home late. <i>Lo quiero.</i>

81
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:33,060
I love you. All right,
then we gotta get into the city.

82
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:41,660
Hey, hold up, hold up.
Your hands hurting again?

83
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:44,160
No, it's nothing.

84
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:46,460
Let me see.

85
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,100
Chris.

86
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,120
It's swollen.

87
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:58,380
Sickle cells must be
blocking the blood flow again.

88
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,780
How long has this been going on?
-Couple days.

89
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,120
Yo, look, I told you.

90
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:06,060
You gotta tell me these things.

91
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,960
You fighting this alone
or we fighting it together?

92
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,560
Together.

93
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:13,900
On team?

94
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,840
On team.

95
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:24,800
Two foot ten,
two foot stop touching everything.

96
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,500
Oh hell, no.

97
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,280
Chris, what I tell you
about letting your man

98
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:31,800
come out the crib looking like a
whole square? -There's so much I could do.

99
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,560
Yeah whatever bro, look. Here.

100
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,660
My dog.

101
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:40,100
When you gonna let me put your skills
to work and get you some real money?

102
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:43,800
It says the dude can't even afford cable.
-Hit the guy who done went away.

103
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:46,880
I choose not to purchase cable.
It's my own personal way.

104
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,880
The protest of vampiric
nature and modern day capitalism.

105
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:13,480
Take a look with that
interview with that dusty suit.

106
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:39,640
Look at this. -Hey guys.

107
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:43,240
That's a good one, but the inkling stars?
Most of the armor diamonds are new.

108
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:58,940
Thank you so much.
Thank you, thank you for being here.

109
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,740
Intern, intern, I paged you three times.

110
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:02,760
Why didn't you call me?

111
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,420
Okay, well, I figured if I stopped the call,

112
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:07,340
they would make me later.

113
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,900
The police are here.

114
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,880
They busted an art auction.

115
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,300
The owner claims that everything is authentic,

116
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,720
but they want a second opinion.

117
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,160
All right.

118
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,760
The Da Vinci sketch is legit.

119
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,240
The paint is a copy.

120
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,780
Well, one's at the
National Gallery in London.

121
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:31,100
Roman Vaz.

122
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,980
Valuable, but you are not gonna retire.

123
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:40,520
Sinners Greek curse tablet,
it would be expensive, but it's a fake.

124
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,140
How can you tell?

125
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,440
See the speller? Roman.

126
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:46,660
Doesn't even show up in our era.

127
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,740
Got it.

128
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,100
Officers, I figured it out.

129
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,520
So, the Da Vinci, that is...

130
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:06,340
Now where did you come from?

131
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,540
What are you?

132
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:25,540
It's pretty neat, right? -Yes.

133
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:29,240
Where is it from?
-They just discovered it in Sudan.

134
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:33,340
The boys say it's Horus,
5th millennia BC Nubian.

135
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:36,040
This symbol is definitely not hieroglyphic.

136
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:38,940
Well, if it's as exotic as it looks,

137
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,340
I'm gonna get a feature in Minerva.

138
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,240
Julian.

139
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:47,740
Okay, team. Let's do it.

140
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:08,620
Okay, what are the rules?

141
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,980
Girls before hoes.

142
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:15,180
Don't be a problem.

143
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:18,460
Don't go looking for a problem.
-Or else we're gonna have a problem.

144
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:20,220
I know, I know.

145
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:22,380
Okay, I'll be back in a little bit.

146
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:30,260
Mr. Diaz?

147
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:36,200
Hey, I know we're a little behind on the bill...
-Three months behind and until your account is current

148
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,720
you can't bring your brother here.
I've told you that. -I'm gonna fix it.

149
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:41,360
I just need a little more time.
-You can always take him to the ER.

150
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:47,960
Well, they won't see him in the ER unless
he's critical. -Mr. Diaz.. -He's 11 years old.

151
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:52,940
Come on crispy, we got to go.

152
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:55,640
What happened?
-Tell you later, man, right?

153
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,660
Come on, let's get out of here.

154
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,400
Hey, you sit here.

155
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,740
Don't move.

156
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,740
<i>After a conference with Simpson's attorney,
Howard Weitzman, Simpson...</i> -Can I help you?

157
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:14,380
Yes. Hey, I'm here for an interview
with the head of security, Mr. Bishop.

158
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,840
I'm Noah Diaz.

159
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:19,120
It's been canceled.
-No, it hasn't been a mistake.

160
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:21,560
Then write for Mr. Bishop.

161
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,720
Mr. Bishop. -Hey! Hey!

162
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:30,020
It's okay, Walker.
-It's me, Noah Diaz.

163
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:34,220
Sir, I think your boy back there is confused.
He said our interview is canceled. -Because it is.

164
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,320
Wait, why? On the phone
you said I was perfect for the job.

165
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:38,720
You said this was just a formality.

166
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:41,420
It was until your old
commanding officer called me back.

167
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:44,920
Said you were brave,
an expert Comtech, but unreliable.

168
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:48,120
Couldn't trust you.
Your head was always somewhere else.

169
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:52,020
Sir, I can't explain all of that. I had
some responsibilities at home. My brother...

170
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:55,120
You had responsibility to the United States Army.

171
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:58,720
Mr. Bishop, sir, I'm a hard worker. Okay?

172
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:00,720
I just...

173
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:03,020
I just really need a break.

174
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,720
Listen, I can't have someone like you

175
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,720
mess up what I built.

176
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,920
Someone like me?

177
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,720
You don't know anything about me!

178
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:20,020
I know you don't know
how to be part of a team.

179
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,720
My God.

180
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:27,020
Hey, look, Superman
went on a bunch of interviews

181
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,920
before he got his job
on the Daily Planet.

182
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:32,720
Man, he never gave up.
-I'm not Superman, Chris.

183
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,920
Life ain't a comment, though.
-I'm just saying, you'll get the next one.

184
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,820
Yo, there is no next one.

185
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,920
No one's coming to save us.
We're alone in this.

186
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,720
Hey, man, I'm sorry.

187
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:55,420
Sorry. -No, it's not.

188
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:01,020
None of this is.

189
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,720
Know what?

190
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:11,820
Come on.

191
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,720
Go ahead, bro.

192
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:18,620
Let's head upstairs.
I'll be right there, all right?

193
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,020
So what was you talking about earlier?

194
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,240
Hey yo, you want one?

195
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:48,380
No, I don't want any candy.

196
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,320
You gotta relax, B.

197
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:53,360
Your energy is really
affecting my chi, and I get it.

198
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,920
I was nervous my first time too,

199
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:58,320
but you might wanna do some
breathing exercises or something. Look at me.

200
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,920
My man, my man, my man, my man.

201
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:09,700
It's just, I ain't done this before.

202
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,560
I know that,
but them rich cats in there,

203
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:16,000
they give a ton of paper to charities
every year to make themselves feel better.

204
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:19,740
Hell, if you look at it from a
holistic perspective, we doing them a favor.

205
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,600
Hey, yo, you're well!

206
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,560
Yo, B, stop!

207
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,560
What are you doing?

208
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:27,440
This ain't about to affect their pockets at all.

209
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:31,120
And it's about to be easy as hell.
-So why you ain't the one going in there doing it?

210
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,080
Because, Papito, I'm the mastermind.

211
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,780
Now, come on, put this in your ear.

212
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,280
My man, you serious?

213
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,640
Yo, is that even clean?

214
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,040
It's the fourth quarter.

215
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:44,080
We got about 10 seconds left
on the clock, and you got the rock.

216
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:46,460
That's too much. -Well, hey, man!

217
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:50,160
Don't slam the...

218
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:58,800
Okay, I'm off to my fundraiser.

219
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,300
What do you think?

220
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,000
It's nice.

221
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:05,800
Can I, can I have something by you?

222
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,640
Hey.

223
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:13,440
So I've been doing some research,
and I don't think that the statuette is Horace.

224
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,640
As a matter of fact, I'm sure it's not.

225
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:18,940
The boys dated it around 5000 BC, right?

226
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,140
But the Nubians,
they never even had contact

227
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:24,900
with the Egyptians
until 600 years after that.

228
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,640
The symbol's not hieroglyphic.

229
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,640
I don't even think it's
from that part of the world.

230
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,940
I think it might be Aztec or Inca.

231
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,640
It's not some Egyptian god.

232
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,640
It's something else.

233
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,640
Interesting.

234
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,640
Get those pressed, okay?

235
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,560
Yeah.

236
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,760
There you go.

237
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:14,260
Let that breath fill you up. In, out.

238
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,360
Knees, stop talking.

239
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,060
OK, all right. I get it.

240
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:21,360
You don't like to chit chat back
and forth, but I got something for you.

241
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,560
We got a Robin mixtape?

242
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:30,860
No. I got a liberating mixtape.

243
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,100
You're feeling that, huh?

244
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,320
Yeah, whatever.

245
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:55,840
Aight, there shouldn't be nobody
in this part of the building.

246
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,380
We shouldn't be able
to just walk right on in.

247
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,360
Strike one, that's the mind.
This place is packed.

248
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,720
Hey, Walter, everybody is divine.

249
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,440
Just act like you own the place.

250
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:11,060
Hey, what's up, brother?
Good to see you again.

251
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,720
Try not to look suspicious.

252
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:18,740
Here you go, here you go.
Sorry, sorry. That's you, bro.

253
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:22,000
Nice glasses.
I didn't know you had glasses.

254
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,300
What are you doing, making friends?

255
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,240
Everything good?

256
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,040
We're here to mix.

257
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:40,280
Hey.

258
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,480
Let's see what you really are.

259
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,800
Now my man said it's tucked in the back.

260
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:57,000
Been there a couple weeks.

261
00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:01,500
It's like the grayish car
with like a... -Little stripe.

262
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:20,200
Alright now just like
brother Rick showed you.

263
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:22,300
Down the window.

264
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:25,100
A little wibble.

265
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,400
Feel that snag and...

266
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,800
Yeah.

267
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:31,900
Now we makin' money.

268
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:58,400
All right, talk to me, homie.

269
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,660
I'm in.

270
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:01,660
It's quite a bit.

271
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,840
Stop, stop! Please.

272
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,860
No, no, no, no.

273
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,840
I'm gonna lose my job.

274
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,600
I'm gonna lose my job.

275
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:55,600
Stefan, Nynobean.

276
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,100
This cannot be.

277
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,600
Calling all Autobots! Calling all Autobots!

278
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,600
Yippee ki-yay!

279
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:48,600
Prime, this is RC. I have a visual.

280
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,600
What am I looking at?

281
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,600
A way home.

282
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:01,500
Calling all Autobots! Calling all Autobots!

283
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:09,300
What am I doing?
-Wel, the cops is clear out here,

284
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:12,100
so whenever you want to slide
that thing on out, you good.

285
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,940
I can't. I can't.

286
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:16,600
Like you can't drive stick
or something? -No, it's just...

287
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,600
it ain't no thief.

288
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:20,900
Are you having an existential crisis now?

289
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,100
The deadline for that was
when I offered you Twizzlers.

290
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,100
This is an emergency.
Can you hear me, Mirage?

291
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,200
Roll out.

292
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:31,100
Yo, who the hell was that? -It's the
radio bro. This car is bugging. I'm out.

293
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,200
Hey!

294
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:37,220
Shit. Oh shit.

295
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:40,100
Hey you!

296
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:42,380
Get out of the car!

297
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:45,980
I'm trying. The car started by itself.
I promise. Look, it's not working.

298
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:47,720
Get out now!

299
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,620
Hold up, wait! What you doing?

300
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,540
Nos?

301
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:04,520
Breathe, breathe, breathe!

302
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,700
Now let's talk to your manifestation.

303
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:10,300
Dude, the car is driving by itself!

304
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:14,480
Noah, you good?
-I don't know what's going on!

305
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,980
It won't stop!

306
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:18,020
Stop, stop! Why don't you listening?

307
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:20,960
But you might want to slow down.
-It's not me. The car is possessed.

308
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:24,280
No, no, no.
You just saw the adrenaline hot.

309
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,780
Let's do some of them breathing exercises.

310
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,700
Yo, I don't need no breathing exercises.
The car's driving by itself.

311
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:34,140
No. No.

312
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:36,460
No, Reek, what do we do?

313
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:38,140
No, I cannot hear you.

314
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:40,240
Reek! -No, I can't.

315
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:46,840
No, we did not.
No, you did not just leave me.

316
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,640
Pull over! -Help me!

317
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:34,180
Drive. Drive, drive, drive!

318
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:50,900
The bridge. The bridge,
take the Williamsburg!

319
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:02,740
I got a 10-37 in progress, silver Porsche.

320
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:06,940
How serious, man?

321
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:13,740
Oh, nah. Oh, nah.

322
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:23,940
Help me with something, please!

323
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:37,740
Oh! Yo, nah!

324
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:39,740
Nah, nah, nah!

325
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:47,440
Come in, come in!

326
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,740
Can you hear me, Mirage? -What?

327
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:03,440
Four us.

328
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,840
Yo, yo, slow down! Slow down!

329
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:41,280
Woo hoo hoo!

330
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,840
That felt good!

331
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,200
Get some oil pumping, you know!

332
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,760
Damn!

333
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,160
I haven't cooped up forever, dude.

334
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,320
I can't tell you how old it gets.

335
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,300
Mirage, stay hidden!

336
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:55,440
Mirage, don't draw any attention to yourself!

337
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:58,080
Mirage, big is just a movie!

338
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,440
You'll never be a real boy!

339
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:02,840
But that was fun, man. You're fun, dude.

340
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:06,940
Alright. This is probably a lot for you, huh?

341
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:11,440
Back off! -Hey, whoa, whoa,
what's with the aggression.

342
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:15,240
Well, I thought after the car chase
we were boys. You gonna hit me?

343
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,440
Maybe.

344
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:18,440
Just like that?

345
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:27,140
Tough guy. I like that. I like it a lot.

346
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:31,280
What are you? Some sort
of possessed car or something?

347
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:34,560
Nah, that's not real man. I'm an alien.

348
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,720
Like, like E.T.?

349
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:40,320
E.T., the little ugly guy
in the basket? Look at this face!

350
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,120
The name's Mirage.

351
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:47,760
Come on, give me a little,
give me a little, give me a little tap.

352
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:49,240
Give me a little tap.

353
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:51,380
There you go, now we're friends.

354
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:54,040
Oh great, the gang's here.

355
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:55,440
They're more like you?

356
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,400
Like me?

357
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:59,400
Nah, but be cool so they
don't crush you. -What?

358
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:02,000
Yeah, I'd put that
pipe down if I were you.

359
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:31,300
Well, well.

360
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:32,780
Soon we got here.

361
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:40,400
Mirage, what have you done?

362
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:42,900
You brought a human here?

363
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:45,620
Optimus, hey! Looking good, man!

364
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:47,380
Wait a second, are those new ribs?

365
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:49,460
You were told to stay hidden.

366
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:51,460
Right, right. Crazy coincidence.

367
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:53,700
When you called all Optimus-like...

368
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:55,860
Autobots roll out!

369
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:59,720
This guy was already in the car,
but he's cool, so it's cool. Cool?

370
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:02,660
Not cool.

371
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:06,420
Who are you, human?

372
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:11,280
I'm nobody. I ain't even seen nothing.
I'm not even seeing anything right now.

373
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,380
RC.

374
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:18,380
Private Noah Diaz, US Army.

375
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:21,180
Multiple commendations,
a wizard with electronics.

376
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:23,320
He's a soldier.

377
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:26,380
He does not look like a soldier.

378
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:28,960
I mean, you're looking
pretty rough yourself.

379
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:31,940
Sorry, sir.

380
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:34,360
I will deal with your mistake later.

381
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,340
- Okay, the energy surge we felt

382
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:43,340
was in the 4000 yadahertz range,
which is undetectable to humans.

383
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:46,340
I've reconstructed
the source from the energy echoes.

384
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:50,340
I cannot believe it.
It exists and it is here.

385
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:52,340
What the hell am I looking at?

386
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:57,340
The transwock key. It was thought
to be lost thousands of years ago.

387
00:31:57,340 --> 00:32:04,340
It was once used to open space-time portals
to energon rich planets throughout the universe.

388
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,340
You mean energon-rich planets like...

389
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:08,340
Cybertron.

390
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:11,220
After seven long years stranded on Earth,

391
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:13,880
we finally found a way home.

392
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,560
Where did that catch you, Lake?

393
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:18,560
Okay, so where is this tran...

394
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:20,220
Transwarp Key? -Thank you.

395
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:22,100
It's in the new museum on Ellis Island.

396
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:23,220
Let's blow it up!

397
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:24,760
Get the hell out of that.

398
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:27,900
No, we can't just go in blasting and steal it, B.

399
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
The humans will hunt us down.

400
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,340
What we need is a quiet way in.

401
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:39,940
Ooh, how about him?

402
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:40,940
No.

403
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:42,340
What? Come on, man.

404
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:44,540
He could slip in right
through one of them little doors.

405
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:47,240
Grab the key, leave a
nice IOU, and peace out.

406
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,640
He's perfect.

407
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,040
What?

408
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:52,240
No, it is a bad idea.

409
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,040
I agree with big man.

410
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,540
So, it's been real, y'all?

411
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:58,440
What? -Time out.

412
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:00,740
No, no, I know. I know who to relax.

413
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:02,640
Let me just talk to my guy real quick.

414
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,940
Yo, don't leave me with these tight asses, bro.

415
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:06,140
We make a great team.

416
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:08,140
This is a waste of time.

417
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:10,900
Look, I'm not bringing in
a museum for some space robots.

418
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:13,900
But what about for friendship?

419
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:16,100
Uh, uh, or, or, or...

420
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:18,500
What about for cash?

421
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:22,620
You help us get this key
so we can get off this rock.

422
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:23,460
No offense.

423
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:24,860
Love the neighborhood and all.

424
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:28,660
And then I let you sell me.

425
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:30,380
Lambo?

426
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:31,980
Ferrari?

427
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:34,620
Elite?

428
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:37,820
Look, you get paid, and then I'll split.

429
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:39,640
So all I gotta do is walk in and out.

430
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:42,600
All you gotta do, we'll take care of the rest.

431
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,900
Cross my spark and hope to die.

432
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:47,360
Wow, that was corny when I said it out loud.

433
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:52,200
And what about the big man, Optimal or whatever?

434
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,640
You let me worry about him.

435
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,480
Cool?

436
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:00,160
Ah, got him, easy baby, woo!

437
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:29,040
So y'all are robots that transform into cars,

438
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,520
even though you're from way out in space.

439
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:34,120
But now there's this key
that opens a portal back to your home?

440
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:37,040
Oh, and you know this because
there's a beacon light in the sky

441
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,960
that I can't see because I'm human.

442
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,560
You say that like it's weird.

443
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,560
It's super weird.

444
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,720
You know what's weird?

445
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:44,920
Marky Mark is leaving the funky bunch.

446
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,960
I heard he's just gonna pursue acting now.

447
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,820
That's crazy.
-What? How does that even...

448
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,480
What a world.

449
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,720
Whatever, man.

450
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:53,160
I'm just trying to collect this money

451
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:56,160
and get your angry-ass boss
off Earth before he blows a gasket.

452
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,520
Don't take it personal.

453
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,640
He just misses home.

454
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:02,940
And I think he blamed
himself for us getting stuck here.

455
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:05,020
Earth was supposed
to be a pit stop, you know?

456
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:09,360
A place for us to regroup
and rejoin the war back home.

457
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:11,660
Prime feels like it's his
fault we've been stranded here.

458
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:14,620
Like, he has to fix it all on his own.

459
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:15,860
All right, team, heads up.

460
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:16,960
There's security up ahead.

461
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,000
Nice.

462
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,580
This is going to be fun, man.

463
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:21,740
No, bro, you need to switch it up.

464
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:23,380
You need to turn into a helicopter

465
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:25,040
or a speedboat or something.

466
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,220
I got something way better than that.

467
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,060
Good call.

468
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:46,440
I do not like this plan.

469
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:49,440
Yeah, Mirage isn't really known for being quiet.

470
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,640
At least Mirage is one of us.

471
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:54,180
We should not be relying on a human.

472
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:55,680
They are my friends.

473
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:59,680
I know one was good to you,
Bee, but this is not our world.

474
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:02,680
The humans will always protect what is theirs.

475
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:05,680
We can only trust our own kind.

476
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,680
You can't handle the truth!

477
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:11,680
I do not want you going to
that drive-in theater anymore.

478
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,480
Nightbird, search the island.

479
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:04,480
Finally, the hunt draws to a close.

480
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:32,980
Hello?

481
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:51,160
Fudge.

482
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,540
Are you okay?

483
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,200
Yo, you okay?

484
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:04,340
I didn't think anyone was in here.

485
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,200
That's it.

486
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,380
Who are you?

487
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:16,680
I'm a janitor.

488
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:20,240
So get ready!

489
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:22,420
No, no, no, you don't have to do that.

490
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:26,640
It's not what it looks like. -It looks
like you're trying to steal museum property.

491
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:28,980
Okay, it's a little what it looks like.

492
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:36,040
Hey! Hey, hey,
it doesn't belong to you anywhere.

493
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:39,960
Just stop, just...
Hey, hey, relax, relax.

494
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:43,960
And let me explain, it belongs to...

495
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:47,940
To these... 

496
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:53,940
To these giant robots from space.

497
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,040
Really?

498
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:58,080
Look, I'm gonna need that. Stop!

499
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:02,100
Damn! -Damn?

500
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:03,820
Hey, hey, hey!

501
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:05,460
What's going on here? Don't move!

502
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:07,680
Man, it's about time you showed up!

503
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:16,420
The key.

504
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,620
You were telling the truth.

505
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:45,120
Yeah, but those ones aren't with me.

506
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:55,620
Rip the flesh from their
bones and bring me the key.

507
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,920
It's yours.

508
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:14,620
Guys, we got company!

509
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:24,160
Autobots, protect the key!

510
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:40,280
Not so fast!

511
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:48,280
Oh, they're flying now?
Who the hell are these guys?

512
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:00,280
Impossible.

513
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:03,360
I enjoy that look of confusion

514
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:07,120
when an inferior being
meets a higher power.

515
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:18,600
What the hell are those things?

516
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,500
Are you okay?

517
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:27,000
Hey, stop follow me.
-I'm not follow you.

518
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,300
I'm just escaping
in the same direction.

519
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,020
We're moving.

520
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:27,460
Keeping strong.

521
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:30,940
You put that dust in your arm.

522
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:33,800
It's sick of losing.

523
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:41,140
I don't give it what you want.

524
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:42,780
Just as...

525
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:50,500
Run!

526
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:51,840
Go, go!

527
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:03,680
Run!

528
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:06,280
Go, go, go, go, go!

529
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:10,280
Get her out!

530
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:16,580
How is that?

531
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:19,240
Thanks.

532
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:27,100
Scourge, I have eyes on the key.

533
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:31,340
Prime, I don't think
we can hold these guys...

534
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:33,340
No! No!

535
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:34,780
Oh my god! Put me down!

536
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:36,220
No!

537
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:39,780
Whoa, I'm so scared.

538
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:42,380
Oh, cool, you're still alive.

539
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:45,900
Get the key!

540
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:48,900
Noah, get out of here!

541
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,900
Get off me! I hate spiders!

542
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:55,900
Go, go, go!

543
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:02,900
Go! Get out of here!

544
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:12,300
Leaving some soon?

545
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:15,400
Come on, go!

546
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:20,780
Vicky!

547
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:28,840
Enough of these games,
I'll get it myself.

548
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:30,800
Not on my watch.

549
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:01,920
Don't be frightened, humans.

550
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:04,920
This'll all be over soon.

551
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:10,920
And you call yourself a prime?

552
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:13,920
Primus would be ashamed.

553
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:30,920
I'm tired of little things
getting in my way.

554
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:32,920
Bee!

555
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:35,920
Look back to my chapter.

556
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:37,720
No!

557
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,920
Bee...

558
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:06,040
Now to add a prime to my collection.

559
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:20,840
Maximus. -Good.

560
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:22,840
Maybe we'll get a real fight.

561
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:26,340
Now we got what we came for.

562
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:37,360
This cannot be.

563
00:46:54,860 --> 00:46:57,820
We must go now. Come with me.

564
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:23,880
This is my fault.

565
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:25,560
It should have been me.

566
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:29,240
I'm sorry for your loss.

567
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:32,440
 No offense lady,
but who are you again? 

568
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:35,640
My name is air razor.

569
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:40,980
I am a maximal, a warrior
from both your past and future.

570
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:44,480
 Oh, right. That tracks. Yeah.

571
00:47:44,580 --> 00:47:48,340
We fled our whole planet
on the eve of this destruction. 

572
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:51,840
We sought refuge and hit here on earth. 

573
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:56,540
Alright so you're a Maximal, y'all are Autobots,
what was those things that attacked us earlier?

574
00:47:56,540 --> 00:48:04,140
Terraconts. Servants of a dark hungry god
who feeds on entire worlds to sustain himself.

575
00:48:04,140 --> 00:48:09,420
Unicron. -So you're saying this
thing Unicron eats planets to survive? 

576
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:18,400
Yes. And heimbues his servants like scourge
with dark energy which makes him all but invincible.

577
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:25,480
He is entirely beholden to Unicron.
Through his power, he possesses Scourge's soul.

578
00:48:26,180 --> 00:48:29,480
Awaken my dark master.

579
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:50,160
Rise.

580
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:53,160
My hunger is killing me.

581
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:55,160
What have you found?

582
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:56,160
Salvation.

583
00:48:56,160 --> 00:49:01,120
The galaxy will once again
be yours to feast on my master.

584
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:08,000
I should have gotten the key myself.
I should have known better than to rely on humans.

585
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Hold up, were you blaming me?

586
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:14,080
After you conveniently left out
the part about a planet eating monster?

587
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:18,680
Because of you, Unicron will now use
the key to consume every planet in the universe.

588
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:21,440
Including my home world.

589
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:24,720
He doesn't have the key.
At least not all of it.

590
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:26,920
You fool!

591
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:30,720
This is only half the key.

592
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:33,720
Freeze the Maximals!

593
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:36,720
They must have split it!

594
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:37,720
Excuses!

595
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:43,120
Complete the key or else you will wish
you had died with the rest of your planet.

596
00:49:43,220 --> 00:49:49,720
We broke the key into two pieces for
safe keeping, then splintered and went into hiding.

597
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:52,920
I do not know where the other half is.

598
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:57,920
For all I know, I am the last of our kind.

599
00:49:58,420 --> 00:50:00,420
This in Peru?

600
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:01,920
How do you know that?

601
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:03,920
It's the symbols on the stone.

602
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:06,920
They were only ever recorded
in one other place in the world.

603
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:09,220
The Inca Temple of the Sun in Cusco.

604
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:11,920
It's one of the oldest buildings
in the Western Hemisphere.

605
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:15,920
I'm guessing that that
can't be a coincidence.

606
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:19,920
If you can track those symbols
to Peru, so can the Terracons.

607
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:21,920
We need to get there before they do.

608
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:26,640
And then kill Scourge and take
his piece to complete the key.

609
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:28,640
Now hold up. Hold up.

610
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:33,720
You wanna find this other key and
deliver it to the guy that just kicked your asses?

611
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:36,000
The transwarp key is our only way home.

612
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:39,280
If this dude gets a hold of that thing,
it's game over for Earth.

613
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:41,280
Our families, everybody.

614
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:46,320
I'm going.

615
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:47,760
Out of the question.

616
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:49,840
No offense.

617
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:53,980
But I'm not trusting my home
to a guy who couldn't even protect his.

618
00:50:54,380 --> 00:50:56,180
It's my planet.

619
00:50:56,180 --> 00:50:57,480
I'm going.

620
00:50:57,480 --> 00:50:59,480
What about you?

621
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:02,880
Me?

622
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:04,880
What is your name?

623
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:06,380
Elena.

624
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:08,180
Elena.

625
00:51:08,180 --> 00:51:10,480
Will you lead us to this temple?

626
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:15,780
Chance to stop the end of the world.

627
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:17,480
Actually,

628
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:20,080
you'll be saving two worlds.

629
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:29,440
Yeah.

630
00:51:38,540 --> 00:51:41,040
Yo, is that you, Sonic?

631
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:45,720
What you doing up, Tails?

632
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:47,760
I can't sleep.

633
00:51:58,200 --> 00:51:59,740
It's too hot?

634
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:02,580
You playing that game too much.

635
00:52:02,580 --> 00:52:04,780
Give it a rest
so your hand can take a break.

636
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:06,620
I'm gonna beat it.

637
00:52:08,620 --> 00:52:10,620
My money's on you, bro.

638
00:52:10,620 --> 00:52:12,060
We don't quit.

639
00:52:12,060 --> 00:52:14,720
Come on, get some sleep, all right?

640
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:26,180
Yo listen, I gotta head out for a while.

641
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:28,420
I don't know when I'm gonna be back.

642
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:30,440
Why?

643
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:34,920
Oh shit!

644
00:52:39,340 --> 00:52:42,420
Oh no, oh no!

645
00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:44,380
Stop, stop, please, turn it off!

646
00:52:44,380 --> 00:52:46,420
What are you doing?
I told you to sit tight!

647
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:51,140
Is not enough? I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
-Is that a robot? -No, no. Go back to bed.

648
00:52:51,180 --> 00:52:52,180
Shut it off!

649
00:52:52,180 --> 00:52:56,100
I had hot wires, so I messed up my life.
-I got the bat. -Give me that.

650
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:58,700
Did he say bat?
-You gonna wake up Mom.

651
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,140
I know you're a robot.

652
00:53:06,940 --> 00:53:08,860
Chris!

653
00:53:16,180 --> 00:53:18,180
Yo! You scratched my paint!

654
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:21,180
What are you doing?

655
00:53:21,180 --> 00:53:23,180
Man, they didn't treat E.T. like this.

656
00:53:23,180 --> 00:53:27,180
You know this thing?
-Yeah, we're just work friends.

657
00:53:27,180 --> 00:53:30,180
Work friends? You've been inside me.

658
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:35,180
Look, the thing I told you I have
to go do is wear him and his crew.

659
00:53:35,180 --> 00:53:37,180
We're trying to stop the end of the world.

660
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:38,180
The world's ending?

661
00:53:38,180 --> 00:53:41,180
No, maybe. Sixty, forty.

662
00:53:41,180 --> 00:53:43,180
You know I'm not gonna let that happen.

663
00:53:43,180 --> 00:53:45,180
But that's why I have to leave.

664
00:53:48,180 --> 00:53:50,720
I'll go get my things.

665
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:53,020
Tough kid. -What? No.

666
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:55,060
Whoa, whoa. Hold on, hold on.

667
00:53:55,060 --> 00:53:58,360
You're not coming. -Why?
You need someone to watch your back.

668
00:53:58,380 --> 00:54:00,720
It's too dangerous, Chris.

669
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:03,820
And I need you to stay here
and take care of Mom.

670
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:08,560
'Cause you might not come back.

671
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:23,440
Hey, robot.

672
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:26,440
Me? What's up?

673
00:54:27,140 --> 00:54:30,840
Watch out for my brother. Okay?

674
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:32,740
You got it, little man.

675
00:54:32,740 --> 00:54:34,440
Nah, I'm serious.

676
00:54:34,540 --> 00:54:37,240
If he gets hurt, I'm coming after you.

677
00:54:38,940 --> 00:54:41,440
Don't worry. I got Noah's back.

678
00:54:41,540 --> 00:54:43,380
I promise.

679
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:47,680
Hong-Ting?

680
00:54:50,180 --> 00:54:51,800
Hong-Ting.

681
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:57,400
Kid's got heart.

682
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:13,700
Wu Tang is in the building, baby!

683
00:55:13,700 --> 00:55:16,060
Way to be incognito.

684
00:55:16,060 --> 00:55:18,740
Aw, come on, Prime. Smile a little bit.

685
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:20,940
It won't hurt.
Let me see that underbite.

686
00:55:20,980 --> 00:55:22,060
All right.

687
00:55:22,060 --> 00:55:24,260
So what kind of jet we taking to Peru?

688
00:55:24,260 --> 00:55:27,440
Or is it a plane? Either one's fine.
I just need first class, okay?

689
00:55:27,460 --> 00:55:28,700
'Cause I got long-ass legs.

690
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:30,580
Well, he is a plane.

691
00:55:30,580 --> 00:55:31,820
No, no, no.

692
00:55:31,820 --> 00:55:34,180
Don't tell me we're flying on...

693
00:55:34,180 --> 00:55:35,780
Oh no!

694
00:55:53,580 --> 00:55:58,180
My lads! I am Stratosphere,
Lord of the Skies!

695
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:07,680
Yeah, I'm walking to Peru.

696
00:56:18,180 --> 00:56:20,180
Oh my gosh.

697
00:56:24,180 --> 00:56:28,680
But I think you're moving too fast.

698
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:30,780
Sorry.

699
00:56:30,780 --> 00:56:33,700
I sing when I get nervous.
It usually calms me down.

700
00:56:33,740 --> 00:56:35,520
First time flying?

701
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:39,000
And it's my first time leaving New York.

702
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,320
Oh, my god.

703
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:42,640
Oh, god.

704
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:44,920
So the Bronx, huh?

705
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:48,460
Brooklyn, all right?
East New York all day.

706
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:51,080
I'm from Bushwick. -Really?

707
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:55,680
Me and my dad,
we used to go to this pizza spot

708
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:57,240
down on Nickafauka and Green.

709
00:56:57,240 --> 00:56:58,640
Tony's Pizza?

710
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:00,180
Wow.

711
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:07,120
Tell me about your pops.

712
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:12,160
What was he like?
-He was a cabbie for 40 years.

713
00:57:12,660 --> 00:57:15,000
Smartest guy you ever met.

714
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,160
They could talk to you about anything.

715
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:20,200
History, science, cricket.

716
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:22,040
Cricket?

717
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:25,300
He ain't never even go to college either.

718
00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:27,240
I used to always say,

719
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:29,760
if you keep your eyes and your ears open,

720
00:57:30,260 --> 00:57:33,280
life will show you
everything you need to know.

721
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:38,840
So that's why you say yes to all of this?

722
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:40,860
I figured if he is somewhere watching,

723
00:57:40,860 --> 00:57:44,960
then seeing his daughter
do something crazy like this,

724
00:57:45,460 --> 00:57:47,700
would definitely make him proud.

725
00:57:57,540 --> 00:57:59,940
Do you really think
this key thing's in Peru?

726
00:57:59,940 --> 00:58:01,540
I think so.

727
00:58:01,540 --> 00:58:04,540
The evidence lines up.

728
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:07,740
You know, if it is,
when we get our hands on it,

729
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:09,840
you know we gotta destroy it.

730
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:11,540
What?

731
00:58:11,540 --> 00:58:14,540
It can't unite the key
without both pieces.

732
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:18,220
No key, no Unicron,
no Earth-game Eden.

733
00:58:22,180 --> 00:58:25,220
Yeah, but didn't they kick you?

734
00:58:25,420 --> 00:58:27,520
We gotta think about us.

735
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:33,600
All you gotta do is find it,

736
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:35,600
and I'll take care of the rest.

737
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:43,700
Do you think an energon
infusion could bring him back?

738
00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:48,700
Perhaps if we could
get him back to Cybertron.

739
00:58:50,700 --> 00:58:53,900
I never should have
taken us so far from home.

740
01:00:24,380 --> 01:00:26,900
Wow, wheeljack needs
to fix that power steering.

741
01:00:29,740 --> 01:00:33,000
Sorry I'm late.
I was taking in a harmonious moment

742
01:00:33,020 --> 01:00:36,720
between a serene butterfly
and an unruffled caterpillar.

743
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:38,860
Substrung queasy.

744
01:00:38,860 --> 01:00:41,140
Yo, oh yeah, papa, where you from?

745
01:00:41,140 --> 01:00:42,240
Cybertron.

746
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:43,660
So where'd you get that accent?

747
01:00:43,660 --> 01:00:45,080
Accent? What accent?

748
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:47,220
You know what I'm saying?
I'm just, I'm saying it's cool.

749
01:00:47,300 --> 01:00:49,840
Like I was about to be like, yo,
<i>mira papa y de donde eres.</i>

750
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:52,780
I didn't want to assume
that you speak Spanish too.

751
01:00:52,780 --> 01:00:54,480
Because then, right?

752
01:00:54,780 --> 01:00:57,280
A little racist, Hermano.

753
01:00:57,280 --> 01:00:59,280
I'm not trying to be, you know, yo.

754
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:01,280
But anyway, the mission.

755
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:02,780
Follow me.

756
01:01:02,780 --> 01:01:05,280
He's a robot, like, so...

757
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:07,280
How's that racist?

758
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:12,780
Okay, guys, check this out.

759
01:01:12,780 --> 01:01:15,780
The coordinates you gave me
correspond to an old church.

760
01:01:15,780 --> 01:01:17,580
Take a look.

761
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:21,560
That's Santo Domingo.

762
01:01:21,560 --> 01:01:23,520
The Spanish built it on top of a Oinca temple.

763
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:26,660
<i>Correcto.</i> I picked up some
residual energy readings

764
01:01:26,740 --> 01:01:30,140
around the courtyard, so I'm
guessing the key's somewhere close by.

765
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:32,800
But we may have
some trouble getting there.

766
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:36,720
Indiraimi, it's a festival
that shuts down the whole city.

767
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:38,160
Guess it's a night mission then.

768
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:41,640
No, Scourge could already be here.

769
01:01:41,640 --> 01:01:44,920
We must retrieve
the other half before he does.

770
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:48,720
Me and Elena will do it.

771
01:01:48,820 --> 01:01:51,120
Y'all never make it two blocks.

772
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:54,120
There's human security all around
the church. You'll never get through.

773
01:01:54,120 --> 01:01:56,720
Then we'll have to take
a play out of your book.

774
01:01:56,820 --> 01:01:58,920
We'll hide in plain sight.

775
01:01:59,020 --> 01:02:01,420
We'll blend in with the parade.

776
01:02:01,620 --> 01:02:04,120
It is not a bad idea.

777
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:07,120
We will keep an eye out for the Terracons.

778
01:02:07,620 --> 01:02:11,120
Our first sign of trouble
we are going in.

779
01:02:11,120 --> 01:02:13,120
Yo, Noah, think fast.

780
01:02:19,120 --> 01:02:22,260
And if you need help just holler.

781
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:39,280
I am in position.

782
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:41,280
Alright, coast is clear.

783
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:44,280
Noah, Elena, it's go time.

784
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:47,280
Blend in. Act natural.

785
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:25,060
Autobots must be using
their new pets to reach the temple.

786
01:03:25,160 --> 01:03:27,060
Lovely.

787
01:03:27,060 --> 01:03:30,060
They're doing our work for us.

788
01:03:30,060 --> 01:03:32,080
Go fetch.

789
01:03:36,380 --> 01:03:39,140
Key's gotta be in here somewhere.

790
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:41,040
Yeah.

791
01:03:54,760 --> 01:03:57,240
That stone work is 17th century.

792
01:03:57,240 --> 01:04:03,240
What we're looking for
is something much, much older.

793
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:13,500
What is it?

794
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:15,880
It's the same insignia on Air Raiser.

795
01:04:15,880 --> 01:04:17,540
But it's not lined up right.

796
01:04:20,140 --> 01:04:22,080
Wait, you see that?

797
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:26,200
I think there's something under here.

798
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:32,540
There's another one.

799
01:04:47,240 --> 01:04:49,200
Now where?

800
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:51,440
I thought it was...

801
01:05:05,940 --> 01:05:08,840
It's some "Indiana Jones"-type shit.

802
01:05:09,240 --> 01:05:10,840
You sure about this?

803
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:13,340
No.

804
01:05:21,840 --> 01:05:25,340
Any sign of Scourge?
-Nope. All clear here.

805
01:05:25,540 --> 01:05:28,240
Yeah, it's just groupies over here.

806
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:33,740
Stay on task, Mirage.
-Prime, you gotta learn how to relax, my man.

807
01:05:56,440 --> 01:06:00,340
You know, you must be the first people
to walk here in half a millennium.

808
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:05,840
Yo, Sonic, you dead yet?

809
01:06:06,340 --> 01:06:07,840
No.

810
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:09,840
Wait, did you just call me Sonic?

811
01:06:10,340 --> 01:06:12,440
I think that's a temple.

812
01:06:18,840 --> 01:06:20,840
What are we looking for?

813
01:06:20,840 --> 01:06:22,840
You see the symbols on that temple?

814
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:24,840
The master wants a courtyard.

815
01:06:24,840 --> 01:06:26,840
I think it's up there.

816
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:39,720
I think we found what we came here for.

817
01:06:42,560 --> 01:06:44,900
I always wondered what
it would feel like to be there

818
01:06:44,900 --> 01:06:47,100
when artifacts were actually found.

819
01:06:49,980 --> 01:06:52,440
All right. Now come on, push.

820
01:07:00,540 --> 01:07:02,540
Are you even pushing?

821
01:07:02,740 --> 01:07:04,740
Yeah, I'm pushing.

822
01:07:14,540 --> 01:07:16,540
Wait. Wait, what?

823
01:07:16,540 --> 01:07:17,540
Just let me think.

824
01:07:17,540 --> 01:07:20,040
Oh, no. Where is it?

825
01:07:20,180 --> 01:07:24,540
Sometimes there's like
a false bottom or something.

826
01:07:28,700 --> 01:07:31,100
Look, I think I found something.

827
01:07:31,100 --> 01:07:32,460
You see these symbols?

828
01:07:32,460 --> 01:07:33,940
I've seen markings like this.

829
01:07:33,940 --> 01:07:36,180
The air raises statue of my museum.

830
01:07:36,180 --> 01:07:37,700
They're new.

831
01:07:37,700 --> 01:07:40,260
They're not on the trans-woke key.

832
01:07:40,260 --> 01:07:42,300
There's two of them.

833
01:07:50,840 --> 01:07:52,540
Raj.

834
01:07:55,540 --> 01:07:57,240
Let's keep moving.

835
01:07:57,240 --> 01:07:59,240
Just give me a second.

836
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:04,240
Run!

837
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:14,240
Go, go, go!

838
01:08:15,240 --> 01:08:18,740
We got trouble! One of the things
is down here! Where are you guys?

839
01:08:18,740 --> 01:08:20,740
Hang tight! I'm on the way!

840
01:08:24,140 --> 01:08:27,740
The Autobots are moving.
They must have found the key.

841
01:08:41,740 --> 01:08:43,740
Airazor, where are the humans?

842
01:08:43,740 --> 01:08:45,900
The Underground, heading towards the jungle.

843
01:09:03,900 --> 01:09:06,120
Aw, man! They're tailing us!

844
01:09:15,320 --> 01:09:17,820
Do something! -You moving in too?

845
01:09:25,220 --> 01:09:27,320
We had a gun this whole time.

846
01:09:44,920 --> 01:09:47,620
Prime! What the hell are you doing?

847
01:09:47,720 --> 01:09:53,220
I'm going to take that scourge's
key and then take off his head.

848
01:10:05,220 --> 01:10:06,520
Guys!

849
01:10:06,720 --> 01:10:08,220
I can use a little help!

850
01:10:08,220 --> 01:10:10,220
Did someone call for backup?

851
01:10:18,720 --> 01:10:20,220
Wait, wait, wait! -What?

852
01:10:20,220 --> 01:10:22,220
Wait!

853
01:10:32,940 --> 01:10:35,600
This is for me.

854
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:49,600
Come here.

855
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:51,460
Hold on.

856
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:13,660
I love your fire, Prime,

857
01:11:13,660 --> 01:11:17,700
but you're going to die
on this speck of dust.

858
01:11:17,700 --> 01:11:21,200
I can think of no
better place to bury you.

859
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:51,200
I will end your scourge.

860
01:11:54,200 --> 01:11:56,560
That is a promise.

861
01:11:56,560 --> 01:11:58,560
They're getting away.

862
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:00,560
Not this time.

863
01:12:07,560 --> 01:12:09,880
I hear water.

864
01:12:13,480 --> 01:12:15,560
Where are we?

865
01:12:21,300 --> 01:12:23,180
What was that?

866
01:12:36,440 --> 01:12:38,320
Who are you?

867
01:12:38,420 --> 01:12:40,680
Why are you hunting for the key?

868
01:12:40,680 --> 01:12:42,840
Yo Donkey Kong,
stay away from my friend.

869
01:12:42,840 --> 01:12:44,000
Oh, Mariah.

870
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,200
Don't worry, your boy's got this.

871
01:12:48,120 --> 01:12:51,480
Stranger danger, stranger danger!

872
01:12:51,480 --> 01:12:53,620
Hey, hey, hey!

873
01:12:53,620 --> 01:12:55,120
Not so fast!

874
01:12:58,780 --> 01:13:00,320
Aye, aye, aye.

875
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:02,860
- Hey, over here, kitty kitty.

876
01:13:03,460 --> 01:13:05,480
Stand down!

877
01:13:08,920 --> 01:13:11,400
I won't ask a second time.

878
01:13:16,100 --> 01:13:18,400
No! All of you, stop!

879
01:13:21,400 --> 01:13:22,600
Arid!

880
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:27,400
Primal, I thought you were lost. All of you.

881
01:13:27,400 --> 01:13:30,400
The others, are they?

882
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:33,400
I am all that is left.

883
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:40,200
Prime, these are my fellow Maximals.

884
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:43,000
Rhinox. Cheetor.

885
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:44,900
Sorry about scaring you, brother.

886
01:13:44,900 --> 01:13:48,200
Scared? Please, I'm not scared.

887
01:13:48,300 --> 01:13:50,400
That's just engine oil.

888
01:13:51,200 --> 01:13:54,400
And our leader, Optimus Primal.

889
01:13:55,400 --> 01:13:57,400
Optimus Primal?

890
01:13:57,600 --> 01:14:01,900
Named after you,
the legendary warrior of Cybertron.

891
01:14:02,200 --> 01:14:04,200
It's an honor.

892
01:14:04,900 --> 01:14:07,700
Airazor, I'm happy to see you, old friend.

893
01:14:07,700 --> 01:14:10,900
But bringing others here
was not part of our plan.

894
01:14:11,100 --> 01:14:13,400
I fear you bring dark tidings.

895
01:14:13,700 --> 01:14:17,840
Scourge has come to earth.
-He's found us.

896
01:14:17,940 --> 01:14:20,440
And he has half of the key.

897
01:14:20,540 --> 01:14:23,240
We must find the
second piece before he does.

898
01:14:23,240 --> 01:14:26,140
But it wasn't in a cave. -It was. 

899
01:14:26,240 --> 01:14:30,940
But we moved it long ago to keep it safe.
-Where is it now?

900
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:35,900
Come with me.

901
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:45,160
That doesn't look so good.

902
01:14:45,160 --> 01:14:49,160
When Skurge touches you,
he leaves a mark.

903
01:14:49,160 --> 01:14:51,160
But I'll be all right.

904
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:06,560
Hey, back then you called me Sonic.

905
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:07,560
Yeah.

906
01:15:07,560 --> 01:15:11,560
Your little bro's got this thing about
using real names over the airwaves, so...

907
01:15:11,660 --> 01:15:13,260
You been talking to Chris?

908
01:15:14,060 --> 01:15:16,560
He gave me this to keep tabs on you.

909
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:18,560
Make sure I'm keeping my promise.

910
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:19,560
Oh, here.

911
01:15:19,560 --> 01:15:21,560
Next time, include warning labels.

912
01:15:21,560 --> 01:15:22,560
Nah, go ahead.

913
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:24,260
Keep it.

914
01:15:24,360 --> 01:15:26,560
I guess it does look better on me.

915
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:29,560
Just don't ask where
part of my body it came from.

916
01:15:32,160 --> 01:15:34,560
So, who are you?

917
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:40,560
We Maximals are an advanced race, dedicated
to the expansion of life throughout the universe.

918
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:44,560
We use the Transwarp Key
to visit young worlds.

919
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:49,560
The Nazca Lines? The temple at Tikal?
That was you guys, right?

920
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:53,960
Not us. We cannot claim
credit for human ingenuity.

921
01:15:54,060 --> 01:15:57,560
But you had the key.
Why stay on this world?

922
01:15:57,560 --> 01:16:03,020
When Unicron destroyed our world, we took
an oath dedicated to the preservation of life.

923
01:16:03,220 --> 01:16:05,300
No matter the cost.

924
01:16:05,400 --> 01:16:07,900
And Earth has been a safe refuge.

925
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:48,900
This is Amaru.

926
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,900
He and his family are
the last descendants of a tribe

927
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:55,500
that has watched
over us for hundreds of years.

928
01:16:55,700 --> 01:16:59,500
When we arrived,
they shared their world with us,

929
01:17:00,100 --> 01:17:02,500
and together we protected its people

930
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:05,500
and our secret.

931
01:17:12,500 --> 01:17:14,500
You allied with humans?

932
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:17,000
We did.

933
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:24,500
If you give us this key, tomorrow I will
light the beacon and bring Scourge to us.

934
01:17:25,100 --> 01:17:29,500
The Maximals have already sacrificed
one home to protect the universe.

935
01:17:29,500 --> 01:17:31,500
I won't risk losing another.

936
01:17:31,700 --> 01:17:34,920
As a leader, I know you understand.

937
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:02,460
He is not the Optimus Prime I imagined.

938
01:18:03,220 --> 01:18:06,220
Well, he has lost so much.

939
01:18:06,220 --> 01:18:11,120
Many more will perish
if the key falls into the wrong hands.

940
01:18:11,220 --> 01:18:17,220
If you had another chance to save
our home, would you act any differently?

941
01:18:21,220 --> 01:18:24,720
Optimus, come. I want to show you something.

942
01:18:29,220 --> 01:18:31,620
Your friend will find peace here.

943
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:36,220
This is raw energon.

944
01:18:36,220 --> 01:18:38,220
The valley is rich with it.

945
01:18:38,220 --> 01:18:40,220
Could this revive be?

946
01:18:40,220 --> 01:18:43,220
I'm sorry, but in this state it is inert.

947
01:18:43,220 --> 01:18:46,220
It will take a great power to ignite it.

948
01:18:46,220 --> 01:18:49,220
Greater than anything we have here.

949
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:55,220
I see that you are surprised
we entrust the key to them.

950
01:18:55,220 --> 01:18:57,220
Yes I am.

951
01:18:57,220 --> 01:19:00,220
I've been amongst them a long time now.

952
01:19:00,220 --> 01:19:03,540
There is more to them than meets the eye.

953
01:19:03,540 --> 01:19:05,560
They are worth saving.

954
01:19:40,120 --> 01:19:42,400
What if we didn't destroy you?

955
01:19:43,820 --> 01:19:48,620
Maybe there's another way
to save both our homes.

956
01:19:48,820 --> 01:19:52,140
Alaina, I made a lot of mistakes in my life.

957
01:19:53,540 --> 01:19:55,180
This is different.

958
01:19:57,680 --> 01:19:59,740
I can't fail at this.

959
01:20:00,340 --> 01:20:03,020
I can't let my family down.

960
01:20:03,020 --> 01:20:05,040
You're just like him.

961
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:07,460
You know that? -Who?

962
01:20:07,480 --> 01:20:08,680
Optimus.

963
01:20:08,680 --> 01:20:12,220
I'm serious.

964
01:20:12,220 --> 01:20:13,500
He feels it too.

965
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:15,220
Feels what?

966
01:20:15,220 --> 01:20:19,780
Like a beast of burden,
just trying to carry the weight

967
01:20:19,780 --> 01:20:22,660
of the world on his shoulders.

968
01:20:22,860 --> 01:20:28,440
You think he's some general
barking orders, but when I look at him,

969
01:20:28,860 --> 01:20:32,300
all I see is a big brother
trying to protect his family.

970
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:30,540
Are you okay?

971
01:21:36,760 --> 01:21:38,300
Who is it?

972
01:21:38,300 --> 01:21:40,860
I can feel Scourge.

973
01:21:41,460 --> 01:21:42,820
Kiss.

974
01:21:42,820 --> 01:21:44,780
You're mine.

975
01:21:54,420 --> 01:21:56,500
Run, Elena.

976
01:21:59,300 --> 01:22:00,940
No!

977
01:22:03,340 --> 01:22:05,380
Eraser.

978
01:22:06,680 --> 01:22:08,980
They found us.

979
01:22:08,980 --> 01:22:11,440
Everyone, defensive position.

980
01:22:12,040 --> 01:22:14,780
Noah, guard the key.

981
01:22:14,780 --> 01:22:17,220
Take Elena and find someplace safe to hide.

982
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:21,120
We must protect the humans.

983
01:22:23,620 --> 01:22:25,460
Miss me?

984
01:22:25,660 --> 01:22:27,900
Noah, Elena, get out of here!

985
01:22:44,860 --> 01:22:46,940
We have to destroy it.

986
01:22:48,540 --> 01:22:49,620
No.

987
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:51,620
No.

988
01:22:52,320 --> 01:22:54,120
Don't.

989
01:22:56,800 --> 01:23:00,280
I know you want to protect your people.

990
01:23:00,280 --> 01:23:05,840
But if you destroy that key,
our home will be lost forever.

991
01:23:05,840 --> 01:23:08,320
We do not have to choose.

992
01:23:14,820 --> 01:23:16,980
Please, Noah.

993
01:24:04,120 --> 01:24:06,000
Elena!

994
01:24:10,840 --> 01:24:13,900
Wait, wait, didn't I kill you already?

995
01:24:16,200 --> 01:24:19,920
No, I'm the Maximal,
it's going to rip out your spark.

996
01:24:20,920 --> 01:24:22,840
We'll see about that.

997
01:24:22,940 --> 01:24:24,880
Kill them.

998
01:24:30,920 --> 01:24:32,520
There is a note!

999
01:24:32,520 --> 01:24:35,440
I can't hold it back

1000
01:24:36,140 --> 01:24:38,140
longer.

1001
01:24:38,240 --> 01:24:40,440
Find it, Airazor.

1002
01:24:40,440 --> 01:24:42,440
Remember our oath,

1003
01:24:42,440 --> 01:24:44,040
primal.

1004
01:24:44,040 --> 01:24:46,440
No matter the cost.

1005
01:24:46,440 --> 01:24:48,440
I can't hold it back!

1006
01:24:48,440 --> 01:24:50,440
Airazor, no!

1007
01:25:01,440 --> 01:25:02,440
Pramel!

1008
01:25:02,440 --> 01:25:04,640
I knew you could do this!

1009
01:25:10,140 --> 01:25:12,140
This is okay!

1010
01:25:13,740 --> 01:25:15,540
Do it!

1011
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:40,880
Primal.

1012
01:25:41,880 --> 01:25:43,880
No matter the cost.

1013
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:54,880
Alina, Alina, look at me.

1014
01:25:55,680 --> 01:25:57,480
Are you okay?

1015
01:25:59,880 --> 01:26:01,880
Scourge has the key.

1016
01:26:45,940 --> 01:26:48,480
Awaken, almighty Unicron.

1017
01:26:48,480 --> 01:26:50,700
Your time has come.

1018
01:27:53,800 --> 01:27:55,820
I'm sorry no.

1019
01:27:56,420 --> 01:27:59,220
We were looking out for your own.

1020
01:28:01,420 --> 01:28:03,420
I can't even be angry at you for that.

1021
01:28:03,420 --> 01:28:08,420
On my home world, we believe that
the battle with darkness will continue

1022
01:28:08,620 --> 01:28:10,620
 till all are won.

1023
01:28:11,420 --> 01:28:13,820
I lost sight of that.

1024
01:28:14,020 --> 01:28:21,020
You fought for yours as I fought for mine, when
we should have been fighting the darkness together.

1025
01:28:24,420 --> 01:28:26,420
Well, I ain't done fighting yet.

1026
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:33,920
All right, everybody, squad up.

1027
01:28:33,920 --> 01:28:35,920
Bring it in.

1028
01:28:35,920 --> 01:28:37,920
There's gotta be a way to stop this dude.

1029
01:28:37,920 --> 01:28:39,420
It's too late.

1030
01:28:39,420 --> 01:28:41,920
The transwarp has already been activated.

1031
01:28:41,920 --> 01:28:44,420
It has more energy than a supernova.

1032
01:28:44,420 --> 01:28:48,420
Any interruption will ignite it, like a bomb.

1033
01:28:48,420 --> 01:28:50,420
The only way to stop this process

1034
01:28:50,420 --> 01:28:52,920
is an access code you installed long ago

1035
01:28:52,920 --> 01:28:54,220
as a safeguard.

1036
01:28:54,220 --> 01:28:55,720
Okay, what's the code then?

1037
01:28:55,720 --> 01:28:58,220
The code was split along with a key.

1038
01:28:58,220 --> 01:29:02,420
Sadly, the second half of that code died with Air Razor.

1039
01:29:02,420 --> 01:29:04,120
No, wait, wait, wait. I got it.

1040
01:29:04,120 --> 01:29:06,020
The one hiding her half of the key,

1041
01:29:06,020 --> 01:29:07,420
it had markings in it.

1042
01:29:07,420 --> 01:29:09,920
Just like the ones I found
on the cave where you hid yours.

1043
01:29:09,920 --> 01:29:13,420
Together, they must
complete the access code.

1044
01:29:14,020 --> 01:29:15,920
So we got a chance now, right?

1045
01:29:15,920 --> 01:29:17,520
A slim chance.

1046
01:29:17,520 --> 01:29:19,620
That is all we need.

1047
01:29:19,620 --> 01:29:22,820
If you will show us the way, Primal.

1048
01:29:24,820 --> 01:29:28,340
Alright, we need to move quickly.

1049
01:29:28,340 --> 01:29:32,700
We have a small window before the portal
opens large enough for Unicron to enter.

1050
01:29:32,700 --> 01:29:35,140
The bridge is girded by a series of tunnels.

1051
01:29:35,140 --> 01:29:38,100
They are too small for Maximals, but...

1052
01:29:38,100 --> 01:29:40,000
But not for humans.

1053
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:46,000
If Noah and Elena reach the central antenna,
they could use the code to shut it down,

1054
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:51,980
remove the transwarp key, and close
the portal before Unicron enters our atmosphere.

1055
01:29:52,180 --> 01:29:54,480
But Scourge will be watching our every move.

1056
01:29:54,480 --> 01:29:56,980
He'll do anything to stop us from getting the key.

1057
01:29:56,980 --> 01:29:58,980
Then we bring the fight to him.

1058
01:29:58,980 --> 01:30:03,980
Autobots and Maximals
will charge the bridge together

1059
01:30:03,980 --> 01:30:06,980
and lure Scourge onto the battlefield.

1060
01:30:06,980 --> 01:30:08,980
While me and Elena
sneak it through the back way.

1061
01:30:12,980 --> 01:30:15,480
It sounds like we are going to die.

1062
01:30:16,980 --> 01:30:20,980
If we are to die,
then we will die fighting.

1063
01:30:20,980 --> 01:30:22,980
All as one.

1064
01:30:35,980 --> 01:30:39,360
This world is yours, master.

1065
01:30:40,160 --> 01:30:42,160
Scourge...

1066
01:30:42,260 --> 01:30:44,260
They're back.

1067
01:30:50,460 --> 01:30:52,460
Prime.

1068
01:30:53,860 --> 01:30:58,260
Protect the king.
Don't let them get to the bridge.

1069
01:31:18,560 --> 01:31:23,120
Maximals! Autobots! Roll out!

1070
01:31:34,620 --> 01:31:37,840
Rhinox! Tior! Maximize!

1071
01:32:01,460 --> 01:32:04,460
At least the foot soldiers took the bait.
-Yeah, but Skirt didn't.

1072
01:32:04,460 --> 01:32:05,500
He's guarding the key.

1073
01:32:05,500 --> 01:32:06,980
All right.

1074
01:32:06,980 --> 01:32:09,660
This should lead to the bottom
of the transwarp control panel.

1075
01:32:09,660 --> 01:32:11,460
Get the key, get the hell out of there.

1076
01:32:11,460 --> 01:32:13,340
What are you gonna do?

1077
01:32:13,340 --> 01:32:15,340
I'm gonna go distract Scourge.

1078
01:32:15,340 --> 01:32:16,980
You can't take on Scourge alone.

1079
01:32:16,980 --> 01:32:17,940
Relax.

1080
01:32:17,940 --> 01:32:20,260
I'm Mirage, remember?

1081
01:32:20,260 --> 01:32:21,800
Hey.

1082
01:32:56,860 --> 01:32:59,160
One, two, three, boom!

1083
01:33:02,660 --> 01:33:04,900
We gotta hurry up.

1084
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:10,500
Take cover!

1085
01:33:10,500 --> 01:33:12,340
Get up!

1086
01:33:12,340 --> 01:33:14,740
Someone get me a real fight!

1087
01:33:16,540 --> 01:33:18,720
It's a fight you want?

1088
01:33:18,720 --> 01:33:20,520
You got one.

1089
01:33:33,560 --> 01:33:35,700
He was mine.

1090
01:33:37,600 --> 01:33:39,280
Nope.

1091
01:33:39,380 --> 01:33:41,360
Missed me.

1092
01:33:44,060 --> 01:33:46,520
No one gets any key, Maros.

1093
01:33:47,440 --> 01:33:49,440
What do we have here?

1094
01:33:50,440 --> 01:33:52,440
I let it go!

1095
01:33:56,440 --> 01:33:58,440
Brave, but futile.

1096
01:34:02,740 --> 01:34:05,040
Hey! Don't mess with my boy!

1097
01:34:34,840 --> 01:34:37,940
No one will remember this pathetic planet.

1098
01:34:39,240 --> 01:34:42,240
And no one will remember you.

1099
01:34:45,940 --> 01:34:47,940
Russ, what are you doing?

1100
01:34:47,940 --> 01:34:49,940
Keeping my promise.

1101
01:34:51,440 --> 01:34:52,940
Come on, you gotta get up!

1102
01:34:52,940 --> 01:34:54,940
It's okay, Noah.

1103
01:34:59,940 --> 01:35:02,540
Home, home team.

1104
01:35:03,540 --> 01:35:05,540
Haunty?

1105
01:35:12,940 --> 01:35:14,940
Ross?

1106
01:35:17,940 --> 01:35:19,940
Ross?

1107
01:35:20,540 --> 01:35:22,940
Kill the other human.

1108
01:35:59,580 --> 01:36:03,480
Unicron, you fought bravely,

1109
01:36:03,680 --> 01:36:08,080
but this world is already mine.

1110
01:36:17,480 --> 01:36:19,280
What's so late?

1111
01:36:28,280 --> 01:36:29,980
Go!

1112
01:36:51,320 --> 01:36:54,120
Hey Nokos, you there?

1113
01:36:54,900 --> 01:36:56,640
You saw me.

1114
01:36:56,640 --> 01:36:58,940
Chris. -Noma?

1115
01:36:59,640 --> 01:37:01,400
What's going on?

1116
01:37:01,400 --> 01:37:02,640
Where's Marav?

1117
01:37:02,640 --> 01:37:05,980
He... he's gone.

1118
01:37:06,080 --> 01:37:07,880
Gone?

1119
01:37:11,280 --> 01:37:13,300
No.

1120
01:37:14,400 --> 01:37:16,680
I'm sorry, Chris.

1121
01:37:23,680 --> 01:37:25,840
I'm not gonna win this one.

1122
01:37:26,140 --> 01:37:28,620
We don't lose, right?

1123
01:37:28,960 --> 01:37:32,200
I wish that was true, but I can't.

1124
01:37:38,800 --> 01:37:40,880
Yes, you can.

1125
01:37:42,580 --> 01:37:44,620
No.

1126
01:37:44,720 --> 01:37:47,060
No, I'm not you.

1127
01:37:47,660 --> 01:37:49,200
I hate being sick.

1128
01:37:49,200 --> 01:37:50,760
Whenever I wanna give up,

1129
01:37:50,760 --> 01:37:53,760
you're always there telling me to keep going.

1130
01:37:53,760 --> 01:37:55,600
And now it's my turn.

1131
01:37:55,600 --> 01:37:57,440
Keep going, no?

1132
01:37:58,940 --> 01:38:03,620
You think you're nobody,
but you're the strongest guy I know.

1133
01:38:04,120 --> 01:38:06,120
You guys are so cute.

1134
01:38:06,620 --> 01:38:08,320
The bruh.

1135
01:38:08,420 --> 01:38:10,120
You're alive.

1136
01:38:10,720 --> 01:38:15,320
Yeah, but I'm gonna
need you to take the wheel.

1137
01:38:26,120 --> 01:38:28,120
You can do this.

1138
01:38:32,420 --> 01:38:35,420
You're my brother. Noah Diaz.

1139
01:38:35,520 --> 01:38:37,920
From Wilson Avenue.

1140
01:38:38,420 --> 01:38:41,120
Apartment 2C Brooklyn, New York.

1141
01:38:44,120 --> 01:38:46,520
No names over the airwaves.

1142
01:38:46,820 --> 01:38:48,820
Forget that.

1143
01:38:48,920 --> 01:38:51,120
Let them know who you are.

1144
01:38:54,820 --> 01:38:56,920
Yo scourge!

1145
01:39:01,320 --> 01:39:03,320
Remember me?

1146
01:39:23,860 --> 01:39:27,500
You think you can take me on alone?

1147
01:39:30,200 --> 01:39:32,480
He is not alone.

1148
01:40:18,160 --> 01:40:20,660
I'm not believing Brooke Lemmett.

1149
01:40:34,100 --> 01:40:36,080
Energon.

1150
01:41:05,420 --> 01:41:07,020
Frank!

1151
01:41:09,420 --> 01:41:11,020
Noah!

1152
01:41:27,960 --> 01:41:31,400
I'm getting really tired of you humans.

1153
01:41:38,100 --> 01:41:40,280
I got you.

1154
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:12,560
You again.

1155
01:42:12,560 --> 01:42:14,960
You should have stayed dead!

1156
01:42:36,560 --> 01:42:39,560
I have come here to kick ass.

1157
01:42:39,560 --> 01:42:41,260
Glad to have you back.

1158
01:42:41,260 --> 01:42:45,560
Everyone, guard the bridge.
Elena, shut it down!

1159
01:42:51,560 --> 01:42:53,560
We gotta give her some cover!

1160
01:42:53,560 --> 01:42:55,560
We'll clear the way.

1161
01:42:58,160 --> 01:43:00,560
That's what I'm talking about.

1162
01:43:00,560 --> 01:43:03,560
Engine access code.
How hard could that be?

1163
01:43:07,560 --> 01:43:09,560
You've got to be kidding me.

1164
01:43:14,840 --> 01:43:17,060
Just you and me, Scourge.

1165
01:43:21,860 --> 01:43:25,280
Let's end this once and for all.

1166
01:43:25,280 --> 01:43:27,280
Master, the reinforcements.

1167
01:43:40,280 --> 01:43:41,880
Oh, man.

1168
01:43:48,280 --> 01:43:49,880
All right, I got this.

1169
01:43:49,980 --> 01:43:51,580
Let's go, B!

1170
01:43:59,280 --> 01:44:01,280
Say hallo to my little friend!

1171
01:44:24,280 --> 01:44:26,280
We gotta hurry!

1172
01:44:26,780 --> 01:44:28,280
That's right.

1173
01:44:28,780 --> 01:44:32,280
Yeah, you angry motherfucker!

1174
01:45:07,540 --> 01:45:11,040
You will never see
Unicron take this world!

1175
01:45:18,540 --> 01:45:21,040
You did it! Brooklyn baby!

1176
01:45:21,640 --> 01:45:23,540
No! 

1177
01:45:23,740 --> 01:45:26,340
Unicron will prevail!

1178
01:45:26,340 --> 01:45:28,140
Elena!

1179
01:45:31,020 --> 01:45:35,780
I've had enough, Jeter!

1180
01:45:35,980 --> 01:45:39,460
Time to show you
the real power of the Prime!

1181
01:45:43,660 --> 01:45:46,460
This belongs to a friend of mine!

1182
01:45:59,420 --> 01:46:02,900
The panel is destroyed.

1183
01:46:03,900 --> 01:46:06,080
I can't stop it.

1184
01:46:06,580 --> 01:46:10,940
Autobots, Maximals, retreat to safety.

1185
01:46:10,940 --> 01:46:14,140
I will destroy the key myself.

1186
01:46:14,140 --> 01:46:14,820
Fine.

1187
01:46:14,820 --> 01:46:15,540
No.

1188
01:46:15,540 --> 01:46:17,140
There's got to be another way.

1189
01:46:17,140 --> 01:46:18,880
Bee, protect them.

1190
01:46:27,520 --> 01:46:30,760
Your sacrifice becomes our oath.

1191
01:46:32,060 --> 01:46:35,480
Thank you, my friends.

1192
01:46:40,580 --> 01:46:42,340
Pete!

1193
01:46:42,840 --> 01:46:45,280
We can't leave him out!

1194
01:46:51,520 --> 01:46:53,520
Everyone, find me!

1195
01:47:05,020 --> 01:47:09,700
Don't, prime.
I can give you everything you want.

1196
01:47:09,940 --> 01:47:11,940
Then you die!

1197
01:47:49,820 --> 01:47:50,980
Noah.

1198
01:47:50,980 --> 01:47:52,680
I got you.

1199
01:48:03,460 --> 01:48:05,060
Let me go, Noah.

1200
01:48:05,060 --> 01:48:07,060
Save yourself.

1201
01:48:08,360 --> 01:48:11,060
Till all are one.

1202
01:48:31,060 --> 01:48:33,060
Till all are one.

1203
01:48:45,360 --> 01:48:47,360
Watch it, Brian!

1204
01:49:14,040 --> 01:49:15,840
Yeah baby!

1205
01:49:46,140 --> 01:49:48,540
Unicron. Is he dead?

1206
01:49:48,640 --> 01:49:51,340
Traps, but not dead.

1207
01:49:51,540 --> 01:49:55,340
Evil can never be
vanquished completely. 

1208
01:49:55,440 --> 01:49:57,240
He could return.

1209
01:49:57,340 --> 01:50:04,340
Let him come. United,
we will destroy him once and for all.

1210
01:50:07,840 --> 01:50:12,340
I am Optimus Prime,
leader of the Autobots.

1211
01:50:12,440 --> 01:50:18,640
We have lost the Transwarp Key
and with it our ability to go home.

1212
01:50:21,340 --> 01:50:27,560
But we have gained an ally
in our battle against the forces of evil.

1213
01:50:27,560 --> 01:50:33,080
Forces too powerful for
any of us to defeat on our own.

1214
01:50:33,180 --> 01:50:38,020
But together we might just have a chance.

1215
01:50:46,620 --> 01:50:48,800
I am Noah Diaz.

1216
01:50:49,400 --> 01:50:52,180
What is there to know about me?

1217
01:50:52,180 --> 01:50:54,180
I was raised out in Brooklyn.

1218
01:50:54,280 --> 01:50:56,780
I got a little bro who calls me Sonic.

1219
01:50:56,880 --> 01:51:00,580
And if I gotta help save the universe
in order to save the people I love,

1220
01:51:00,660 --> 01:51:03,120
well then that's what I'm gonna do.

1221
01:51:33,100 --> 01:51:35,200
How you doing, sir?

1222
01:51:35,300 --> 01:51:38,280
You here for the job interview, Noah Diaz?

1223
01:51:38,280 --> 01:51:40,320
I'll tell him you're here.

1224
01:51:41,220 --> 01:51:43,280
<i>This Sunday on 60 Minutes,</i>

1225
01:51:43,280 --> 01:51:46,360
<i>I sit down to talk with Elena Wallace.</i>

1226
01:51:46,360 --> 01:51:49,200
<i>She recently discovered
an underground temple</i>

1227
01:51:49,200 --> 01:51:54,080
<i>with a network of catacombs
dating back to 5000 BC.</i>

1228
01:51:54,080 --> 01:51:55,920
<i>I never could have
imagined making a discovery</i>

1229
01:51:55,920 --> 01:51:57,880
<i>of this significance.</i>

1230
01:51:57,880 --> 01:52:00,500
<i>So it's definitely a dream come true.</i>

1231
01:52:01,500 --> 01:52:03,320
Brooklyn, baby.

1232
01:52:05,040 --> 01:52:08,080
They're ready for you.
-Thanks, sir. -Elevator in the back.

1233
01:52:12,700 --> 01:52:15,040
Why don't you tell me
about your strengths?

1234
01:52:15,040 --> 01:52:17,000
In addition to my
experience with electronics,

1235
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:19,080
I've also been really developing

1236
01:52:19,080 --> 01:52:21,180
my team building skills too.

1237
01:52:22,680 --> 01:52:26,300
That's a... Look,
I'm gonna be honest with you.

1238
01:52:28,300 --> 01:52:29,920
Resume's a little thin.

1239
01:52:29,920 --> 01:52:32,040
Yeah, well, I just recently had a job.

1240
01:52:33,160 --> 01:52:35,520
Working internationally.

1241
01:52:35,520 --> 01:52:37,360
Oh, is that...

1242
01:52:38,560 --> 01:52:40,400
No, don't think it's on there.

1243
01:52:40,400 --> 01:52:43,740
No, it was a short-term contract.

1244
01:52:43,740 --> 01:52:46,280
Oh, well, that's cool.

1245
01:52:46,280 --> 01:52:48,600
Why don't you tell me about that?

1246
01:52:51,300 --> 01:52:53,800
It was in South America,

1247
01:52:53,800 --> 01:52:55,640
so I got to work on my Spanish.

1248
01:52:55,640 --> 01:52:57,800
But my mom was real happy about that.

1249
01:52:57,800 --> 01:53:00,480
You know moms, she's just me.

1250
01:53:00,480 --> 01:53:05,600
But while I was out there, honestly, man,
I was really just like, "Work, work, work, work."

1251
01:53:05,980 --> 01:53:08,940
That's a shame, 'cause I heard
the food is really good in Peru.

1252
01:53:11,480 --> 01:53:14,360
I didn't mention anything about Peru.

1253
01:53:14,360 --> 01:53:16,360
Well, that's where you were, right?

1254
01:53:16,360 --> 01:53:18,680
I was down in Cusco?

1255
01:53:18,680 --> 01:53:23,040
With you and Elena, and your...

1256
01:53:23,540 --> 01:53:26,740
I don't know, call 'em friends?

1257
01:53:31,400 --> 01:53:33,720
What's going on here?

1258
01:53:33,720 --> 01:53:35,720
We know a lot about you, Mr. Diaz.

1259
01:53:35,720 --> 01:53:39,200
Who are you, like the CIA or FBI?

1260
01:53:39,200 --> 01:53:42,360
We are a secret government organization,

1261
01:53:42,360 --> 01:53:44,280
strictly off the books.

1262
01:53:44,280 --> 01:53:47,600
We specialize in global threats,
planetary, loss prevention,

1263
01:53:47,600 --> 01:53:49,520
that kind of thing.

1264
01:53:49,520 --> 01:53:52,200
We're in the middle of an ongoing war,

1265
01:53:52,200 --> 01:53:54,840
and we'd love to have you join the fight.

1266
01:53:54,840 --> 01:54:00,820
You and your whole team.
You know... The big guys.

1267
01:54:00,920 --> 01:54:03,980
No idea what you're talking about.

1268
01:54:04,280 --> 01:54:06,080
That's a good answer.

1269
01:54:06,080 --> 01:54:07,640
All right.

1270
01:54:07,640 --> 01:54:10,440
Either way, I want you to know,

1271
01:54:10,440 --> 01:54:13,040
in lieu of the thanks
of a grateful nation,

1272
01:54:13,040 --> 01:54:16,040
we will be taking care
of your brother Chris's health care.

1273
01:54:16,040 --> 01:54:17,240
All of it.

1274
01:54:17,240 --> 01:54:21,340
From now on, he will have 24/7 access
to the greatest doctors in the world.

1275
01:54:21,400 --> 01:54:25,420
These are doctors who don't ask
their patients about account balances.

1276
01:54:30,680 --> 01:54:31,920
Are you serious?

1277
01:54:31,920 --> 01:54:34,720
You saved the world, kid.
It's the least we can do.

1278
01:54:34,800 --> 01:54:37,360
I don't know what to say.
-We'll work on that.

1279
01:54:39,400 --> 01:54:41,960
Your brother's gonna be just fine.

1280
01:54:47,560 --> 01:54:51,000
Oh, Chris was right, by the way.

1281
01:55:00,160 --> 01:55:03,160
No names over the airwaves. 

1282
01:55:04,260 --> 01:55:07,960
We could really use someone like you, Noah.
Don't you think about it?

1283
01:55:30,520 --> 01:55:32,180
G.I. JOE

1284
01:56:12,860 --> 01:56:14,860
That oughta do it.

1285
01:56:17,060 --> 01:56:21,760
This? This is a complete waste
of your skills and my expertise.

1286
01:56:21,900 --> 01:56:24,500
Think it came out pretty good.

1287
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:27,000
Well, I guess we could call it

1288
01:56:27,100 --> 01:56:29,800
 modern art and sell it
to some cats in Soho.

1289
01:56:29,900 --> 01:56:32,540
No, I'm not selling. -What?

1290
01:56:32,540 --> 01:56:34,480
Why?

1291
01:56:35,280 --> 01:56:37,320
Is this about the five-o' thing?

1292
01:56:37,420 --> 01:56:40,520
No, I told you. I did not ditch you.

1293
01:56:40,620 --> 01:56:43,220
I was running to give it go.
I thought you knew the play.

1294
01:56:43,320 --> 01:56:45,360
All right, let's say I did ditch you,

1295
01:56:45,360 --> 01:56:46,760
even though I didn't.
